            Welcome! I am Mustafa, a certified digital designer and developer,
            with more than four years of work experience. <br />I started in my
            room and became a professional in web development
            <br /> using the popular React node js. Contrary to the popular
            <br /> belief that AI will lead to web development through
            programming, <br />I was able to exploit this to develop my skills
            and take AI as
            <br /> a tool to develop my speed and innovation.
